## Welcome to Yan Yan's Homepage

I am an associate professor with the School of Informatics at [Xiamen University](http://www.xmu.edu.cn), China. 

I received the PhD  degree in information and communication engineering from [Tsinghua University](http://www.tsinghua.edu.cn), China, in 2009.
I obtain my Bachelor's degree from [University of Electronic Science and Technology of China](http://www.uestc.edu.cn), in 2004.

I worked at Nokia Japan R&D center as a research engineer (2009-2010) and [Panasonic Singapore Lab](http://www.prdcsg.panasonic.com.sg/) as a project leader (2011). I have  published more than 80 papers in the international journals and conferences including the IEEE T-PAMI, IJCV, IEEE T-IP, IEEE T-MM, IEEE T-AC, IEEE T-CYB, IEEE T-ITS, PR, ICCV, ECCV, ACM MM, AAAI, etc. 

My interests include computer vision and pattern recognition, especially in facial analysis.

```markdown
Abstract: The publicly available facial expression databases typically contain a small amount of labelled data. In this paper,
to overcome the above issue, we propose a novel joint deep learning of facial expression synthesis and recognition method for
effective FER.  A GAN and a recognition network are integrated in a unified framework to perform facial expression synthesis
and recognition simultaneously.

```markdown
Abstract:  State-of-the-art FAC methods perform face detection/alignment and FAC independently. The inherent dependencies between these
tasks are not fully exploited. In addition, most methods predict all facial attributes using the same CNN network architecture, which
ignores the different learning complexities of facial attributes. To address the above problems, we propose a novel deep multi-task
multi-label CNN, termed DMM-CNN, for effective FAC.
